Enjoy the company of your fellow travelers 

## Code Structure Twigs:
The main code base is written in [coin.html](./blob/master/coin.html)
All subsequent files are attached to it 

The main html file for chatroom is [chatroom.html](./blob/master/chatroom.html) 

*We have used Google Firebase to store the chat datas so in order to use your own company's database . Go to [chatroom.js](./blob/master/chatroom.js) and add your database details i.e- API key into the initialization part of the code .

## Journey Coins

We have introduced a new feature called The Journey Coins . 
These are basically virtual coins that are created for the company which can be used to distribute among users after the user does complete certain perk .

This will certainly be a game changer as people will be excited to use the feature even more with the hope of getting something in return as well .
